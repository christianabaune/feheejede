                            <p> Everytime I open Plex, I get the logo and the application remains at the logo indefinitely until I force stop it and reopen it. This has only started happening since it was updated back in mid-March. The phone I have is a pixel 3, on Android Pie with the March 2019 security update. I wanted to see if anybody else has noticed or been affected with this issue. It's getting really annoying. I'm playing Spotify through an aux adapter into my car stereo, which is turned all the way up. It's still coming out quiet after adjusting Spotify's EQ and I can't find any sound limitations through the Android settings. Any advice. I know I've had my share of having to say "Sorry, it's only available on Android because Android let's you fine tune just about everything whereas Apple keeps things locked down. They each follow completely opposite design philosophies." Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to start a flame war. I have a couple recent high end Apple products that I love (MacBook Pro, iPad Pro) but when it comes to the computer I use most (my Pixel XL) I've gotta have Tasker. I couldn't imagine a life without. 
I have an LG Stylo 3, Android v 7.0 (which I believe is Nougat). I'm on Boost Mobile. The overwhelming majority of my apps do not have the option to move to SD card. Including app I downloaded like Tinder. When searching online, I saw that you have the option to format your SD card as internal memory, but it's not showing on my phone. I'm really bummed because I only have a gig of space left and my new 64gb SD card is going to be pretty useless unless I figure Edit: Video formats supported: -v.reddit. -streamable. -giphy. -gyfcat. -imgur gifv format Ever come across an interesting or funny video on Reddit and want to share it?

When I try to install signal from Google Play I get the message "Your device isn't compatible with this version". Have others had this problem and is there a work around? There used to be a APK download on the signal website but I can't find it anymore. Hi, and thanks for clicking :-) I've been an Android user for the past six years, and am now selling my LG V30 due to its size. I've been getting curious about iOS, and I'm thinking of switching over. To that effect, I'm now debating between an Xperia XZ1 Compact and an iPhone 6s - due to budget (they cost almost the same), and a headphone jack.

Should last a day with my usage Hello all, First off, before the update, I can see my options on top before I see my stocks underneath and the watch list below that. Now, I don't see my options anywhere aside from actually checking the stock itself. Anyone having the same issues.

When using Firefox mobile v.61.0 on Android v.7.0, The promoted/sponsored posts on Reddit (https://i.imgur.com/yC9hQps.png) keep showing up.

Finally got my phone and internet working well, and just wanted to share how it happened. -------------------------- TLDR: Buy an Android phone abroad and use China Unicom as your provider. -------------------------- If you are not an iPhone user, you might have run into the following problem: Android phones purchased in China have increasingly effective hardware and software blocks to installing Google Play services. Android phones purchased abroad come with functional Google servi. When I upgraded from my 2013 Moto X to the 2014, I was disappointed that the larger screen didn't buy me any more screen real estate. Now that lollipop is out and the UI has gotten even bigger, it's worse. I did some comparisons with my girlfriends iPhone 6 this morning, and it hurts even more that her 4.7 inch screen shows significantly more information than my 5.2. Might look into rooting and changing my DPI settings down the road, but just wanted to throw up some comparisons. Anyone "plays" should read "play". I suck at English sometimes. I had a teenage student I was tutoring in English last week. I wanted to give her an audio file to listen to over the week to do her homework. But we had some difficulties. I found a site that had the file. I was able to save it on my computer and long press and save it on my Samsung. I then asked her, how I'm going to give you this link on your iPad. Well she doesn't use email, because she's a kid. I'm not going to use Bluetooth because it never works for me. I can't use vk without going. </p>
